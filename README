Small snippets of (usually heavily commented) programming knowledge/code
examples that I'm gathering over time. Mainly stuff that I want to remember for
the future but fear I might forget the nitty gritty details and will need a
refresher.

These are optimized to refresh my future self's memory, so I make no attempt
nor guarantee comprehensibility to other human beings.
